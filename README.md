### Description
A course designed to get students prepared to conquer the job market.

### Why?
According to CNN, students are currently entering [the worst job market since the Great Depression](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/20/us/bad-job-market-graduates-coronavirus/index.html) due to the pandemic. We have recently successfully navigated the tech job market to land various positions (Software Engineer, Program Manager and Test Engineer) in the following companies: Apple, Microsoft and IBM. 

Life in Tech is a collection of all the information we wish we knew when we first entered the market. It's a 16-week curriculum split into two sections: technical and non-technical. The technical section is meant to teach students how to ace technical interviews and the non-technical section is meant to teach students the skills needed to build their professional network and land job interviews.

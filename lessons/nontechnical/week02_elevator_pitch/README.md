### Elevator Pitch
#### What?
An elevator pitch, elevator speech, or elevator statement is a short description of an idea, product or company that explains the concept in a way such that any listener can understand it in a short period of time.

#### Why?
An elevator pitch is a quick, effective way for you to introduce yourself to someone outside of your network. It is extremely useful to know your elevator pitch for conferences, resumés, and interviews.

An elevator pitch is a great answer to the, "Tell me about yourself," question.

### Formulating an elevator pitch
Before creating your elevator pitch you need to determine what your desired outcome is. What would you like to happen after delivering your pitch? Do you want to secure funding for your idea? Do you want to secure a meeting? Do you want a job? You need to know what you want in order to deliver an effective elevator pitch.

In this lesson, we will be focusing on introducing yourself to someone you've never met before that has connections at a company you're interested in working at.

A good elevator pitch effectively communicates the following:
- Mission
- Unique Selling Point (USP)
- Open-ended question

#### Mission
You should start your pitch by explaining in 1-2 sentences what you do and why it's important. It could be helpful to use some statistics/facts behind your work. Feel free to use your resumé as a guide. Remember to be excited!

_Example_: I founded an organization called, A Kizzle Brand (AKB) to raise awareness for depression and help people through difficult times. Part of this effort includes creating programs tailored towards helping students of all ages achieve their dreams.

#### USP
After explaining your mission you should explain your unique selling proposition (USP), which is what makes you unique. This step is crucial for making a good impression on who you're communicating with.

_Example_: We pride ourselves on working directly with schools or organizations to design programs that most effectively communicate to their student body and have delivered programs in several states including Delaware, New York and Massachusetts.


#### Open-ended question
At this stage of the pitch, the person you're talking to should know your mission and what makes you/it unique. It's important to engage this individual in the conversation by asking them an open-ended question, which is a question that __CANNOT__ be answered with a "yes," or "no."

_Example_: What kind of programs do you feel are important for student development?

### Demo: Delivering my elevator pitch
Here's how I would deliver my elevator pitch.

### Converting your elevator pitch to an resumé objective
- Don't be scared to copy/paste elevator pitch to your resumé


 ### Homework Assignment
Formulate/practice your elevator pitch until you know it by heart. If your resumé has an objective section, convert your elevator pitch to an objective and add it to your resumé. You may be called on to deliver your elevator pitch in class next lesson.

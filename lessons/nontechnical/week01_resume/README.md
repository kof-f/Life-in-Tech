"He who says he can and he who says he can't are usually both right." \
 -Confucius

__Where do I work and what do I do?__ \
I work as a Program Manager at Microsoft and an Adjunct Professor at Delaware State University.


__Why am I teaching this course?__ \
If you're free, you need to free someone else. It's my responsibility to make sure I'm not the only one winning.

__What's one thing I would've told myself in college?__ \
Nothing is out of reach. If you can speak it, it's attainable.


 ### Resumé Template
 #### Why?
Everyone should be using some kind of template for building their professional resumé for several reasons:
- It saves time
- It helps with application systems that parse resumés to autofill job applications
- It looks better
- It is easier to edit

#### Sections
Your template should have the following sections, but they do not need to be in this order:
- Objective/Elevator Pitch (optional)
- Education
- Experience
- Skills
- Interesting facts (optional)


### Tips for choosing a good template
- Choose templates you can download to Word. Stay away from online resumé builders.
- Stay away from templates with pictures (pictures add more bias to the application process)
- It's okay for your resumé to pop with colors, but make sure the colors make sense and are coordinated.
- Make sure the template has the core sections you need.
- It's okay for your resumé to be 2 pages, but you probably don't need more than 1 page.

#### Where?
Below are some resources you can use to find resumé templates:
- [Freesumes](https://www.freesumes.com/)
- [Office Templates](https://templates.office.com/en-us/resumes-and-cover-letters)
- The [template](https://templates.office.com/en-us/balanced-resume-modern-design-tm16402467) I used for my resumé.

If you find another resource while looking for templates or know of another resource, please share it with the class!


### STAR Method
STAR stands for Situation, Task, Action and Result. It's a method used for detailing experience on resumés and in-person during behavioral interviews. 

__Example 1:__ \
_Situation:_ I work at a research lab on campus called CIBiLI where there's a program utilized to classify different protein spectra. Currently, the software runs, but it isn't time efficient. \
_Task:_ I needed to determine how to decrease the runtime of the program. \
_Action:_ I learned how to use GPU programming (CUDA) to speed up the runtime of the program. \
_Result:_ The program's runtime decreased by .15 milliseconds on a small sample dataset. This could lead to several minutes saved on a larger dataset.

__How would I write this on my resumé?__
- Learned how to use GPU programming to decrease the runtime of a widely used application by .15 milliseconds. \
OR
- Learned how to use GPU programming
- Decreased the runtime of a program by .15 milliseconds

Use the STAR method to organize your thoughts about what you did for a specific job experience. Make sure to include metrics in the action or result section of the STAR method, if possible. This will help with interviews and crafting your experience section in your resumé.

### Demo: Editing your resumé template

### Objectives
At the end of this lesson students should be able to: 
- Implement binary search
- Implement merge sort
- Understand the performance differences between merge and selection sort
- Be aware of Big O


 ### Binary Search
 Go through the algorithm in steps, could be pseudo code
 1. Repeat the question in your own words
 2. Check assumptions
 3. Use real examples
 4. Brainstorm solutions and their time/space complexity
 5. Write working code
 6. Test your code

 ### Merge Sort
 Go through the algorithm in steps, could be pseudo code
 1. Repeat the question in your own words
 2. Check assumptions
 3. Use real examples
 4. Brainstorm solutions and their time/space complexity
 5. Write working code
 6. Test your code

 ### Selection Sort
 Go through the algorithm in steps, could be pseudo code
 1. Repeat the question in your own words
 2. Check assumptions
 3. Use real examples
 4. Brainstorm solutions and their time/space complexity
 5. Write working code
 6. Test your code

 Compare selection sort to merge sort using Big O time/space complexity. Make sure to emphasize that selection sort isn't commonly used in technical problems.

 ### Big O
 __What is Big O?__


 ### Homework Assignment
 A question from Leetcode that uses a search/sort algorithm.
